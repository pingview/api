=== Get Change

'GET /changes/link:#change-id[\{change-id\}]'

Retrieves a change.

Additional fields can be obtained by adding `o` parameters, each
option requires more database lookups and slows down the query
response time to the client so they are generally disabled by
default. Fields are described in link:#list-changes[Query Changes].

`meta=SHA-1` parameter. This will use a historical NoteDb snapshot to
populate ChangeInfo. If the SHA-1 is not reachable as a NoteDb state,
status code 412 is returned.
